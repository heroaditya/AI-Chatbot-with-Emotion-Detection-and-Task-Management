The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) has enhanced the human-computer interaction. Traditional rule-based chatbots that has been limited by the pre-defined scripts and their rigid responses, have now been evolved into intelligent conversational agents capable of understanding their context, detecting sentiment, and executing the tasks. This paper presents us the development of a personalized chatbot that integrates sentiment analysis and automated task scheduling to create a more intuitive and productive user experience. Unlike the conventional chatbots which were primarily serving as the information retrieval systems, this chatbot offers emotional intelligence and practical utility, responding to users based on their emotional state while assisting with their daily task management.
The chatbot employs a GPT-2 based conversational model to generate human-like responses, combined with a sentiment analysis module to access user emotions in real-time. Based on the detected sentiments of the user, the chatbot adopts its tone and content, ensuring empathetic and personalized conversations. Additionally, the chatbot leverages the iCalendar API for seamless task automation, enabling users to schedule their meetings, set reminders, and manage events through natural language commands. This dual capability — sentiment-aware interactions and efficient task management — positions the chatbot as an intelligent virtual assistant to be used for both personal and professional applications.
By integrating the AI-driven sentiment analysis and practical task automation, this chatbot exemplifies the next generation of human-computer interaction. Its ability to understand the users’ emotional context and then provide actionable support makes it particularly useful for applications in customer service, personal assistance, and mental well-being management. The system’s performance is evaluated based on its sentiment detection accuracy, response quality, and task execution efficiency, demonstrating its potential as a valuable productivity-enhancing tool.
